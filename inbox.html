                <p class="dis-para">Traveling means going from one place to another for different purposes.
                     They also explore to see the unseen and know the unknown.
                </p>
                <ul class="dis-para">
                    <li>Travelers always travel to the most beautiful places of the world which uphold the existence of nature.
                         All things are created by Allah.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are many means to see the unseen and know the unknown, but traveling is the best of all.
                         For example, Reading books gives us literal knowledge
                    </li>
                    <li> He can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of another country. 
                        I like traveling very much.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="dis-para">Travelling is a part of education. By traveling we can be familiar with the home and abroad.
                     Many of us want to travel to exciting places and meet our new friends.
                     Some travelings are expensive while some are cheap. Leaving our place when we go on traveling, we can see the golden apples growing.

                     This is the same ship we sailed on last April from Miami to England and it felt like coming home for the holidays.
